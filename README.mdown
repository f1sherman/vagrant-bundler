# Vagrant-bundler-tools

This gem is a plugin for vagrant that makes it possible to interact with
bundled gems on the guest directly from the host.

For example you can open a gem bundled on your linux guest in your OSX host's
editor.

## Installation

    gem install vagrant-bundler-tools

## Usage

To open a gem bundled on your guest in your host's editor use

    vagrant bundle open <gem_name>

from the host.

## Other commands

You can also use

    vagrant bundle show <gem_name>

On the host to show path (on the host) to the named gem bundled on the guest.

## Caveats

You will need to set the bundle path on the guest to be a subdirectory of the
project so that the host can access it, for example with

    bundle config path .bundled_gems

in the project directory on the guest.
